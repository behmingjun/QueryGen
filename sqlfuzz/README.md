The current version of the fuzzer supports fuzzing the postgresql.
Steps to try out the fuzzer:

1. Install dependencies\
 $ Install postgresql (https://www.postgresql.org/download/) \
 $ Set up tpch in postgresql (https://ankane.org/tpc-h). Since the fuzzer operates on a database, we choose tpc-h since it has been widely used.\
 $ Install sqlalchemy


2. Run fuzzer\
 $ cd correctness-fuzz/src/sqlfuzz\
 $ ./mutator.py --prob_table prob_table.json --db_info db_conf.json -s seq --queries 100 2>tmp_out\
 $ **prob_table.json** is used for guiding the query generation procedure: it controls which sql operators are more likely to occur in the generated queries.\
 $ **db_conf.json** contains: database name, and table names. These information will be used by the fuzzer to load table data and metadata from the target database.\
 $ **tmp_out** stores queries generated by the fuzzer. We currently printout the generated queries via stderr, while other debugging messages through stdout.
